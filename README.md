# pic_rename
this program will go through your library of pictures and rename them according to the EXIF-Data. 
If there is no Exif Data pictures will not be renamed. If there are Files that aren't JPG or  PNG they will be ignored ... (this could be added)
You just start the script in any directory and it will search within all subdirectories. it will tell you how many pictures it found
and ask you again before processing.
